# Flood Prediction System with Voting Classifier

# About

Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster andÂ occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt, storm surges or the breach of rivers and dams. Flood prediction plays a crucial role in mitigating the impact of natural disasters on communities and infrastructure. This approach aims to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness by aggregating the predictions of individual classifiers. Hence it shows promising performance in flood prediction, contributing to the ongoing efforts for enhancing disaster preparedness and response with proper communication. 

# Features

1. Frequency: Floods occur frequently, making them a common natural disaster globally.
   
2. Causes: Floods stem from heavy rainfall, snowmelt, storm surges, or breached water bodies.

3. Prediction Importance: Accurate predictions aid in mitigating floods' impact on communities.

4. Aggregated Prediction: Combining classifiers enhances flood prediction accuracy and reliability.

5. Disaster Preparedness: Effective predictions improve preparedness, aiding in timely response measures.
