# Flood Prediction System with Voting Classifier

# About

Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt, storm surges or the breach of rivers and dams. Flood prediction plays a crucial role in mitigating the impact of natural disasters on communities and infrastructure. This approach aims to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness by aggregating the predictions of individual classifiers. Hence it shows promising performance in flood prediction, contributing to the ongoing efforts for enhancing disaster preparedness and response with proper communication. 

# Features

1. Frequency: Floods occur frequently, making them a common natural disaster globally.
   
2. Causes: Floods stem from heavy rainfall, snowmelt, storm surges, or breached water bodies.

3. Prediction Importance: Accurate predictions aid in mitigating floods' impact on communities.

4. Aggregated Prediction: Combining classifiers enhances flood prediction accuracy and reliability.

5. Disaster Preparedness: Effective predictions improve preparedness, aiding in timely response measures.

Here, flood is found based on the values of gage height, discharge, temperature and turbidity. If the predicted value is high, then alert notification is sent to the residents of that area.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the voting classifier combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms, for flood prediction. By utilizing key features, we aimed to capture the crucial hydrological dynamics associated with flood events. Through rigorous preprocessing steps, and target variable encoding, we ensured the robustness of our predictive model. The results of the voting classifier exhibit promising performance of about 98.7% in flood prediction, highlighting the potential of ensemble methods in such critical applications. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in enhancing disaster preparedness and response, emphasizing the importance of effective communication strategies in the face of natural disasters.
